# Loan Default Prediction System

## Overview
A machine learning system that predicts loan default probability using Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms. The system evaluates borrower characteristics and loan details to generate credit risk assessments.

## Features
- Dual model architecture (Logistic Regression + Random Forest)
- Precision-Recall curve visualization
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics:
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - Accuracy
  - PR AUC
- Synthetic data generation with realistic financial relationships
- Combined credit scoring formula

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-default-prediction.git
cd loan-default-prediction
Create and activate virtual environment:

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy

Model Details
Logistic Regression
math
Copy
P(default) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \cdots + \beta_nX_n)}}
Random Forest
math
Copy
f(x) = \frac{1}{B}\sum_{i=1}^B T_b(x)
Combined Credit Score
math
Copy
\text{Final Credit Score} = W_1 \times \text{Credit Score (LR)} + W_2 \times \text{Credit Score (RF)}
Evaluation Metrics
Metric	Formula	Description
Precision	TP / (TP + FP)	Proportion of true positives
Recall	TP / (TP + FN)	Sensitivity of the model
F1-Score	2 × (Precision×Recall)/(Precision+Recall)	Balance between precision and recall
PR AUC	Area under PR curve	Overall model performance measure
